	<p>
		All right! Now let's look at a simple one-page form to which we're going to add our
		validation. Adding validation to a page is the same for single or multi-page forms -
		to the information read here is directly transferrable to any API form.
	</p>

	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, at this point we're assuming that it's already been configured
		with the API and the form submissions are being added to Form Tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here's the entire PHP and HTML of our form. It's just a simple "comments" form with four fields:
		subject, name, email and comments.
	</p>
