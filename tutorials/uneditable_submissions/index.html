<p>
	Often, you may find it beneficial to prevent one or more client accounts from editing the
	form submissions. Form Tools lets you customize precisely which field is editable for which
	user. This tutorial explains the steps involved.
</p>

<h4>...Let there be Views</h4>

<p>
	Every time you add a form to Form Tools for storage, a default View is created
	that contains every field. This default View allows every field except the four system
	fields to be editable, namely: submission ID, submission date, last modified date and IP
	address.
</p>

<p>
	Now lets duplicate that View, only preventing any of the fields from being editable.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the Form Tools admin UI, go to the Forms page and click the EDIT link for the
		appropriate form.</li>
	<li>Click on the Views tab.</li>
	<li>At the bottom of that page, select the View you want to duplicate (probably the All
		Submissions View) then click "Create New View".</li>
	<li>You'll now have been redirected to the "Edit View" page. Enter an appropriate name for
		your view (e.g. "All submissions - View Only" or something). Also on this page,
		you may want to change the access type to point to the client account(s) you want. But for
		the sake of this example, we'll leave it alone and just view it with the administrator
		account. Administrators can always view ALL Views, but they are limited to viewing and
		editing those fields specified by the View.
	</li>
	<li>Click on the Fields tab. At the top of the tab there's a checkbox labeled "Allow
		fields to be edited" - check the field and click the "Update View" button at the bottom
		of the page to save the View.</li>
	<li>And we're done! Click the <b>[View Submissions]</b> link in the top right of the page and
		select the new View from the Views dropdown.</li>
	<li>Edit a submission. You should now see all the fields listed, only now they're
		not editable.</li>
</ol>
