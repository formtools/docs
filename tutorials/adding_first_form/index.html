	<p>
		Now that you've installed Form Tools on your webserver, you can start adding forms to be stored
		and accessible within its interface. This tutorial provides a quick introduction to how
		this step works.
	</p>

	<p>
		As mentioned throughout the documentation, Form Tools does <b>not create forms</b> - it
		only processes and stores their content. It was deliberately designed to be "form builder
		agnostic": it doesn't force you to generate your forms through one or other program;
		Form Tools is compatible with <b>any</b> type of web form - even forms stored in Flash
		or Silverlight scripts. As long as it can send a POST request, Form Tools can handle it!
	</p>

	<p>
		Next stop: the two ways to configure your forms to submit their content: <b>POST forms</b>
		and <b>API forms</b>.
