		Finally, after your form has been added and configured via the Form Tools interface, you
		just need to make one final change to push it live. This step is discussed on the final
		step of the Add Form process. On your first form page, again change the
		<b>ft_api_init_form_page</b> function line to this (where X is your form ID):
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page(X);
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		(All you did was remove the second parameter). Now, after you've revisited the "thank you"
		page to ensure that sessions were emptied, all your form submissions should be stored in
		Form Tools!
	</p>
