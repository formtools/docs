	<p>
		From the API's viewpoint, the first page in your form is special. It lets the script know
		that a new user has just arrived and to start logging their form submission as they progress
		through the form. Add this to the very top of your page (before the opening html tag and doctype),
		and make a few minor modifications to it, as discussed below:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("path/to/form_tools/global/api/api.php");
$fields = ft_api_init_form_page("", "test");
$params = array(
    "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
    "next_page" => "next_page.php",
    "form_data" => $_POST
);
ft_api_process_form($params);
?>
{% endcodemirror %}

	<ol>
		<li>
			The path to the api.php file has to be updated for your server
		</li>
		<li>
			Change "submit_button_name_attribute" to the name attribute of your form submit button
		</li>
		<li>
			Change "next_page.php" to the SECOND page in your multi-page form. This is where the user gets
			directed to after submitting this page.
		</li>
		<li>
			If your form contains file fields, add one more parameter to the $params array: the last
			<b>file_data</b> row.

			{% codemirror php %}
$params = array(
    "submit_button" => "submit_button_name_attribute",
    "next_page" => "next_page.php",
    "form_data" => $_POST,
    "file_data" => $_FILES
);
			{% endcodemirror %}

		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Next, make sure your form tag has the following action and method attributes:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<form method="POST">
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] is just a PHP value for the location of the current page. This
		makes the form <b>submit the information to itself</b>. The <b>ft_api_process_form()</b>
		function will take care of redirecting to the next page. One of the nice things about
		posting the submission to itself is that if later on, you choose to add server-side
		validation (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/php_validation/">see
		this tutorial</a>), it's much easier to handle the errors on the same page.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tip: it's generally a better idea to use $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] instead of the name of
		the file, since filenames sometimes change. If that happens, you'd need to remember
		to update the action attribute. But by using the PHP variable, you don't have to
		worry about it!
	</p>

	<p>
		With regard to the form's post attribute, if you want to use method="GET", that's
		fine - just change the PHP line in the top of the from:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
"form_data" => $_POST,
	{% endcodemirror %}

	to:

	{% codemirror php %}
"form_data" => $_GET,
	{% endcodemirror %}
