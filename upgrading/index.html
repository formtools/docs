		Form Tools 2 is actually a combination of components: the Core, Modules, Themes and
		the API, and each component needs to be updated individually. Since upgrading
		each component one by one would be rather tiresome, we created a custom upgrade script
		to simplify matters.
	</p>

	<h3>Upgrading 2.0.3 or later</h3>

	<p>
		After logging in, just click the "update" link. This appears in different locations
		depending on your theme. The default theme shows it in the top right; Classic Grey
		and Deep Blue show it in the left navigation menu. Click that link! This submits
		all relevant information about your installation - namely the versions of the
		various components you have installed - to the Form Tools website. We then do the
		job of figuring out what components have been upgrade and generates a custom zipfile containing
		ONLY those files that have changed.
	</p>

	<h3>Upgrading pre-2.0.3 versions</h3>
	<p>
		After logging in, go to the Settings » Main tab. Here, next to the version number,
		there's a button labeled "Check for Updates". Click it! This submits all relevant information about
		your installation - namely the versions of the various components you have installed - to
		the Form Tools website. We then do the job of figuring out what components have been upgraded
		recently, and let you generate a custom zipfile containing ONLY those files that have
		changed.
	</p>

	<p>
		After downloading this file, you need to overwrite your existing files. Simple upload the
		entire contents of the <b>formtools/</b> folder to your own installation.
	</p>

	<p>
		And that's it! The various components will be upgraded next time you log in.

	<h3>Upgrading Form Tools 1.x to 2.0.x</h3>

	<p class="notify">
		Form Tools 1 is very, very old! You can use the <a href="http://modules.formtools.org/ft1_data_import/">Form
		Tools 1 Data Import module</a>, but please note that this only upgrades older versions of Form Tools to the
		2.0.x branch. At that point, you'd need
	</p>

	<p>
		Honestly, for the few people still using Form Tools 1, I'd suggest either hiring a developer to upgrade you
		or start with a new installation of the latest version of Form Tools.
