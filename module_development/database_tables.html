	<p>
		Depending on what your module does, the information on this page may not be
		necessary. But if you find you need to store data in the database, Form Tools
		provides a number of built-in functions to make your job just that little bit
		easier.
	</p>


	<h4>Storing small amounts of data - settings</h4>

	<p>
		If you only need to store small information snippets - like settings, you may be able
		to get away without adding your own tables. Form Tools comes with a couple of handy
		functions that store data permanently in the main <b>ft_settings</b> table. Give these
		functions a read through for more information on how they can help.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/ft_get_module_settings/">ft_get_module_settings</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/module_development/ft_set_module_settings/">ft_set_module_settings</a></li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Creating your own database tables</h4>

	<p>
		Module database tables should all follow this naming convention (N.B. the <b>ft_</b> prefix
		in these examples actually depends on the users installation, so be sure to always use the
		<b>$g_table_prefix</b> global variable when constructing table names):
	</p>


	{% highlight html %}
ft_module_[module folder name]_[table name]
	{% endhighlight %}

	<p>
		So if our "My Module" module needed its own custom data table, the database table
		would be something like:
	</p>

	{% highlight html %}
ft_module_my_module_data
	{% endhighlight %}

	<p>
		Custom database tables can be created at any point, depending on your needs. Generally
		they're created by your installation function and deleted by your uninstallation function
		- but this is by no means enforced. If need be, you can create your tables within your
		module pages, based on user input.
	</p>
