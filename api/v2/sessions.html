	<p>
		When you use the API for your forms, it uses sessions to store information about the form as the user
        progresses from page to page. The API v1.x had a specific method to start sessions; the API v2.x does not. Instead, sessions are automatically
        started as soon as you instantiate the API class, like so:
    </p>

    {% codemirror php %}
$api = new FormTools\API();
    {% endcodemirror %}

    <p>
        It either uses database or PHP sessions, depending on what value you have set in your
        <b>$g_api_session_type</b> variable (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/getting_started/config_file/">see
        here</a> for more information). If you have problems with PHP sessions, it's recommended that you set that
        value to "database".
    </p>

	<p>
		To control the timeout for the database sessions, set the <b>$g_api_session_timeout</b> value to something
        appropriate. This is in seconds and defaults to 3600 (1 hour). Again, see the
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/getting_started/config_file/">help documentation on the config.php file</a>
		for more information.
