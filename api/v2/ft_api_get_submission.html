	<p>
		The ft_api_get_submission() function does pretty much what you'd expect it to do: it retrieves
		all information about a form submission. Unlike many other API functions, this one is more
		for programmers. It returns a hash of information (where the keys are the database column names
		and the values are the actual values in the field, directly from the database) which you can use
		for whatever you need.
	</p>

	<p>
		The function takes two parameters: <b>form ID</b> and <b>submission ID</b>. Both fields are
		required. Here's an example of how it's called, where the form ID is 2 and submission ID is
		550.
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$submission_info = ft_api_get_submission(2, 550);
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Now, assuming your form has database columns called first_name and last_name, you could
		access those values like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
echo $submission_info["first_name"]; // first name!
echo $submission_info["last_name"]; // last name!
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Tip: to find out what the database columns are all named, log into Form Tools and go to the
		Edit Form » Database tab. There, look at the DB column name column. If you haven't
		already done so, you might want to click the "Smart Fill" button to rename all your database
		columns to the same values as you form fields. This can simplify working with the database
		directly since the column names will be more descriptive.
	</p>
