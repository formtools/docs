        object. Note: the path to the API class file must must be edited for your server. It can be a relative or
		absolute path.
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
require_once("/path/to/[form tools folder]/global/api/API.class.php");
$api = new FormTools\API();
// now you can use all the methods on the $api object
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        <b>Important:</b> you only ever need to instantiate the <code>$api</code> object <b>once</b> on your form page.
        Don't add multiple <code>$api = new FormTools\API();</code> lines or things may not work as expected!
