    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        <b>Please note</b>: this method and its configuration have changed from Form Tools 2. This page explains the
        ins and outs of the <code>displayPostFormCaptchaError()</code> method, but be sure to check out the
        tutorial on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/post_form_captchas/adding_captcha/">Adding a CAPTCHA to your
        form</a> that explains a few other things you'll need to know to get it working on your form.
    </p>

	<p>
		This function was added to help abstract away some of the nagging details of adding CAPTCHA spam detection
        script to a POST form. The function should be included at the top of your POST forms that contain a
        reCAPTCHA. It displays an appropriate error message if the user fails to enter
        the CAPTCHA properly. Usage:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$api = new FormTools\API();
echo $api->displayPostFormCaptchaError();
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		The default error message is <i>Sorry, the CAPTCHA (image verification) was entered
		incorrectly. Please try again.</i> This message always in English. To override it in the
		language of your choice, to change the wording or style the content, you can just pass in
		a string as the parameter, containing whatever HTML content you want. e.g.:
	</p>

{% codemirror php %}
<?php
$error = '<div class="error">Error! Please re-enter!</div>';
$api->displayPostFormCaptchaError($error);
?>
{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		That will then embed that HTML and error message into the page.
	</p>
