	<h4>About the API</h4>
	<a name="about"></a>

	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<a href="https://github.com/formtools/api/releases/tag/1.1.4" class="btn btn-primary">Download</a>
		The API releases are all found on github. Just click the "Downloads - Source Code" zip or tar.
	</div>

	<p>
		The goal of the API is to provide communication between Form Tools and
		the outside world. It contains functionality for tasks such as submitting form
		submissions via PHP code rather than POSTing in the information to process.php,
		accessing and display Form Tools data in your own webpages, managing client accounts
		via code rather than the Form Tools interface and other such helpful functionality.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Form Tools API files should be placed in your <strong>[form tools root]/global/api/</strong> folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		Depending on the needs and requests of users, additional functions are likely to be
		added to this file.
	</p>

	<a name="how_to_use"></a>
	<p><b>How to use it</b></p>

	<p>
		In order to use the API functions you must include the api.php file in your web page
		BEFORE the function call. You only need to include this line once. The path must be
		&nbsp;edited for the location of your api.php file on your server. It can be a relative or
		absolute link.
