	<p>
		The API comes fully integrated with the rather splendid "Recaptcha" service.
		<a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to visit
		their website and learn more about the novel approach they've taken to CAPTCHAs.
		The basic idea is that by solving their CAPTCHAs, you're unwittingly helping digitize
		old books that have been scanned into a computer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of the many CAPTCHA solutions there are out there, we selected this service over
		others due to the usefulness of their approach and the clarity of the CAPTCHAs
		themselves. Too often CAPTCHAs are unclear and hard to decipher by users; recaptchas
		are far more readable.
	</p>

	<p>
		This API function generates a CAPTCHA in your page with a single line of PHP. If the
		user fails to enter the CAPTCHA correctly they are unable to proceed any further through
		your form and the submission is never finalized.
	</p>

	<p>
		This document explains how to get this function working for you.
	</p>

	<h4>1. Get a recaptcha account</h4>

	<p>
		I know it's a pain, but it's very quick. <a href="http://recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html"
		target="_blank">Visit their site here</a> and sign up for an account. Once you've
		created an account you register the domain(s) where you're using the service. Since the
		API only runs on the same server as your Form Tools installation, you'll only need to set up the one domain.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recaptcha will generate two keys for you: a private and a public one. Add
		those two values to your <b>/global/config.php</b> file, like so:
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
$g_api_recaptcha_private_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
$g_api_recaptcha_public_key = "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy";
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		(replace the x's and y's with your own keys).
	</p>

	<h4>2. Add the captcha to your form</h4>

	<p>
		Next, in your form (which should already be integrated with the API with help from the tutorials
		on  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_single_page_form">adding a single page form </a> and
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/api_multi_page_form">adding a multi-page form</a>), add this line where
		you want.
	</p>

	{% codemirror php %}
<?php
ft_api_display_captcha();
?>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		And you're done! Try it out!
	</p>
