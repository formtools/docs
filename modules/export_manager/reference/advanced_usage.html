  <h3>Advanced Usage</h3>

  <p>
    The Export Manager can be used in conjunction with the Form Tools API to dynamically
    display content in your webpages.
  </p>

  <p>
    The API contains two functions -
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/ft_api_show_submissions">ft_api_show_submissions</a> and
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/api/ft_api_show_submission">ft_api_show_submission</a> - which were written to do just this: quickly
    display submission content in your webpages. They work by passing in various values like the form ID, View ID and
    <b>export type ID</b> (see the functions for further information).
  </p>

  <p>
    The export type ID that you pass to the function is all-important. It determines which
    of the export types you want to use to generate the HTML content. By default, the "HTML /
    Printer-friendly" export group has three export types: "Table format", "One submission
    per page" and "One-by-one". Any of these can be used in the API functions to generate the
    HTML in the page. And, of course, you can always create your own custom export types.
  </p>
