  <h3>Data Visualization</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i299.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Data Visualization module was written to provide a simple, high-level visualization
    of your unique form data, letting you - very easily! - visualize what you need through 
    Line Charts, Area Charts, Pie Charts, Bar Charts and Column Charts. In some cases, this 
    can provide merely a novel insight into the information in your form: in other cases, 
    genuinely useful information.
  </p>

  <h4>What it offers</h4>

  <p>
    This module provides a simple interface to create and manage your visualizations,
    assign them to specific forms, and allows you to fine-tune the permissions so that
    each client may see different visualizations (if needed). It lets you embed your
    visualizations in custom pages in the Form Tools user interface and in your own
    web pages. There is no limit to the number of visualizations you can create, and
    each may be customized with its own style.
  </p>

  <h4>Visualization Types</h4>

  <p>
    The current version of this module allows for two ways to visualize your data, but
    depending on demand, we hope to expand this functionality (see the <a href="other/feature_suggestions/">Feature Suggestions</a> page!).

        Activity Charts display the activity on your forms: the frequency of submissions
        during particular periods of time. You may choose between <b>Line Charts</b>,
        <b>Area Charts</b> and <b>Column Charts</b> to display the data.

        Field Charts display the breakdown of content in a single form field. Generally,
        this visualization type is used on multi-select Option List fields, since they
        offer a finite number of values that the field may contain. You may choose
        between <b>Pie Charts</b>, <b>Bar Charts</b> and <b>Column Charts</b> to display
        the data.
