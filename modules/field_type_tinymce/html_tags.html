  <h3>External Form fields contain HTML tags?</h3>

  <p>
    By and large the module is extremely straightforward. But there's one fringe case that you may need to know about.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, forms integrated with Form Tools have all HTML/XML tags stripped from the submission data. This is a
    security measure; it prevents Evil People from doing Evil Stuff like performing XSS attacks on your site. But if
    your own (external) form contains a rich-text editor, you'll want to allow HTML being submitted. To fix this, make
    sure the "Strip tags in incoming submissions" field is set to "no".
