  <h3>Edit Submission page</h3>

  {% include screenshot.html item="i160.gif" %}

  <p>
    The Edit Submission page is where you go to browse the change history for a submission.
    By default, it'll just show a bar along the bottom of the page with a "Load History"
    button, like in the screenshot. But if you think you'll be browsing the submissions a lot
    and want to save time having to click that button each time, just go to the module
    settings and set the "Auto-load history on edit submission page" to Yes.
