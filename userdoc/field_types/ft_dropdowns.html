	<h3>Dropdowns</h3>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i199.jpg" %}

	<p>
		The dropdown field type is very straightforward. There are only two custom options: the
		data source (Options List or form field values from another form) and a section for
		optional comments that appears underneath the field. See the screenshot for an example of
		how it looks.
	</p>

	<p>
		As with all field types, just click the Edit icon on the Edit Form &raquo; Fields tab for the dropdown field
        to get the Edit field dialog.
