	<h4>External Forms</h4>
	<p>
		For External forms, the Add Form process automatically picks appropriate field types for
		each form, to mimic your original form as close as possible possible. In other words,
		textboxes will be mapped to the Form Tools "textbox" field type, radio buttons to radio
		buttons and so on. If you have specialized field types (e.g. a javascript date-picker or
		other non-plain HTML field types), Form Tools will ask you to pick a field type, or
		make its best guess. As with everything in Form Tools: you can always reconfigure the
		field types later, so don't worry!
	</p>

	<h4>Internal forms</h4>

	<p>
		Internal forms are different. When you create an Internal form it creates a form with a
		number of plain textboxes. The intention is to create the base settings for your form
		so you can go in and configure the fields types separately.
	</p>

	<p>
		After the form has been added (External or Internal) you need to go to the Edit Form -&gt;
		Fields tab to change the field types. That's where the action happens!
	</p>

	<h4>The Fields page</h4>

	<p>
		The Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab lists all of your form fields and all related settings. For
		more detailed information on this page, see the
		<a href="/userdoc/form_management/edit_form_fields_tab">Fields page documentation</a>.
		But for now, it's important to know this: you can edit your fields in two ways. The main
		page (shown in the screenshot) allows you to edit the <b>main settings</b> for the fields,
		but nothing more. These settings are shared by all field types, so they're shown in the main
		page. But with 2.1.0, each of the field types may also have <i>custom settings</i> that
		are particular to the field type. For example, a multi-select dropdown has a "Num Rows"
		field setting to control the height of the multi-select dropdown; a file upload field
		has an "Upload Folder" setting to let you customize the folder where the files get uploaded
		to. These settings are unique to those field types and no others.
		To see all these settings, just click the edit icon (the penultimate column). That will
		open a dialog window containing <b>all</b> settings. That dialog window is discussed in more
		depth on the next page.
	</p>

	<p>
		So if you ever want to see every last option for the fields types, click that icon! For
		field types like checkboxes, radio button and dropdowns, you will need to open the
		dialog so that you can assign the data source (i.e. the options that appear in the field).
	</p>

	<p>
		Okay, that gives you a general overview to how these field types are actually used. Now
		let's take a closer look at the Edit Field dialog, then onto the details of the actual
		field types.
