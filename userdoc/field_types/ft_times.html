	<h4>Times</h4>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i202.jpg" %}

	<p>
		This field type is totally new to Form Tools 2.1.0. It provides a simple javascript dialog
		window to let you enter times in a standardized format. The screenshot to the right shows a
		couple of examples of different time formats, how the fields look (with the clock icon)
		and the timepicker itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the Edit Form -&gt; Fields tab -&gt; Edit Field dialog, you are presented with the following
		options:
	</p>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i203.jpg" %}

	<ul>
		<li><b>Custom Display Format</b>: this determines how your time field looks when displayed
			when editing and viewing. <i>Unlike the date field, if you change this value after there
				are already entries in the fields, the old data will not be automatically converted to the
				new format.</i></li>
		<li><b>Field Comments</b>: this field is common to all field types. It lets you add
			some comments underneath the field to better explain what it's about.</li>
	</ul>
