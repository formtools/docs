	<h4>Passwords</h4>

	<p>
		The password field is very basic, so I won't waste a screenshot on it. The only optional
		setting in the Field Comments setting, to allow you to add some comments underneath it.
	</p>

	<p>
		One thing that should be mentioned, however, is that unlike actual Form Tools user
		accounts passwords, <i>password fields in your forms are not encrypted in the database</i>.
		They are stored plain-text and when viewing the data, you will see the password appear
		as it was originally typed in.
