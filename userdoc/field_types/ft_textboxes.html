	<h4>Textboxes</h4>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i193.jpg" %}
		Textboxes are the most common field type. Chances are, most of your form fields are
		textboxes. Before 2.1.0, the only thing you could customize about this field type was the
		size - and that was dependent on the database size allocated. 2.1.0 provides a lot more
		control. The screenshot to the right shows 5 different textboxes, each configured slightly
		differently.
	</p>

	<p class="bold blue">Settings tab</p>

	<p>
		As with all field types, to choose a textbox for one of your fields just go to the Edit Form -&gt;
		Fields tab. There, select the Textbox field type on the main page, or click the Edit icon and
		select it there. As with all other field types, the first tab
		of the Edit Field dialog contains the same information and is
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/field_types/edit_field_dialog">discussed here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i192.gif" %}
		The custom field settings for the Textbox field type are shown in the screenshot to the
		right. Here's what they all mean (but you can probably figure it out by the labels!).
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Size</b>: this controls the width of the field.</li>
		<li><b>Max Length</b>: this lets you control the maximum number of characters that people
			enter into the field.</li>
		<li><b>Field Comments</b>: this setting lets you add some comments to the field. Sometimes
			it can help to provide a little explanation to what information a field is storing - the
			field label (Display Text) may not be enough. Comments appear underneath the field.</li>
		<li><b>Highlight</b>: this displays the textbox in a particular colour: red, orange, yellow,
			green or blue. Sometimes it can help to draw emphasis to particular important fields.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="bold blue">Validation tab</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i331.gif" %}
		As of Form Tools 2.1.4, you can now add field validation to ensure that each field
		contains the appropriate data when submitted through Form Tools.
