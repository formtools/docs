	<p>
		Form Tools 2.0.x included two other "special" field types in addition to the ones discussed already: a WYSIWYG
        editor field, which let you edit your fields in a simple rich-text editor, and a file upload field. With Form
        Tools' new field types structure, it no longer made sense to include them as part of the Core. Instead, they are
        now implemented as separate modules. There are many benefits to this, but the two most important ones are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>this now allows us to update these modules independently of the Core, and</li>
		<li>it allows us to write additional modules to handle file uploading and rich-text
			editing with different modules / scripts.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
