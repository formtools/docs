	<p>
		All right! Now to get down to work. Step 2 lets you configure the main settings for
		your form. This page will look slightly different depending on the submission type you
		selected in the previous step. So make sure you read the right section below.

	<h3>Direct / POST forms</h3>

	<p>
		Here's what each of the settings mean.
	</p>

    <div class="clear"></div>

	<div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Form Name</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This is used within Form Tools to uniquely identify your form. If you're planning on
            adding lots of forms, it's important to give them as descriptive a name as possible
            otherwise you'll forget which is which (believe me, it happens!). Later on, you will
            be able to search the forms on this field.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Form URL</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This is where you enter the URL of your form. This is needed for the later steps:
            it will dynamically load and extract the fields from your form, so it can extract lists
            of radio buttons, checkbox, etc. values.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Redirect URL</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This is the URL of the "thank you" page, where users will be redirected to after they
            have successfully submitted the form. By default, a form has a single redirect URL which
            you should enter here. But here's a sneaky trick: if you actually need to redirect
            to different locations, you can just include a hidden field in your form with the name
            attribute: <b>form_tools_redirect_url</b>. Whatever URL you enter as the value in that
            field will override the value stored in the Redirect URL for your form. Additionally,
            if you want to redirect to different locations based on content from the actual form
            submission, check out the
            <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/submission_pre_parser/field_values">Submission Pre Parser module</a>.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Who can access?</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This setting determines the permissions for the overall form. You will later be able
            to fine-tune these permissions by creating Views for the form, but this setting
            controls the overall settings - who at least gets access to the form.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>API / Code forms</h3>

	<p>
		Here's what all the settings mean on the API / Code form page.
	</p>

    <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-5"><code>Form Name</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
            This is used within Form Tools to uniquely identify your form. If you're planning on
            adding lots of forms, it's important to give them as descriptive a name as possible
            otherwise you'll forget which is which (believe me, it happens!). Later on, you will
            be able to search the forms on this field.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-5"><code>Is this a multi-page form?</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
            This is pretty self-explanatory, but note that by <i>multi-page</i> it really means
            separate URLS. Form that have multiple pages hidden/shown with javascript still
            count as a single form page. If you select "yes" for this, the next setting will let
            you enter multiple URLs instead of just the one.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-5"><code>Form URL / Form URLs</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-7">
            It's important to enter all the URLs of your form, preferably in order. Don't worry
            about including your "thank you" page. Likewise, if your form includes a "review" page
            that displays the information to the user prior to submitting it, unless it includes
            new form fields, that does not need to be included.<br />
            <br />
            Unlike Form Tools 1.x, the Add Form process now configures all the multi-select
            field options (radios, checkboxes, select and multi-select), and to do this properly,
            it needs to examine the contents of each page of your form. That's why you need to
            manually enter each form URL. It may seem like a pain, but it actually proves to be an
            immense time-saving device!
        </div>
    </div>


	<h3>Check URL buttons</h3>

	<p>
		Every URL field on this page has a corresponding "Check URL" button. These open a dialog
		window containing the URL you just entered, so you can easily confirm that they
		have been entered correctly. Generally it's a good idea to verify all URLs to confirm
		they're correct. If they are incorrect, a later step will be unable to read the fields
		and populate the field options for the page.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: this feature has changed since 2.0.x versions: it no longer opens in a popup window
		or forces you to confirm them. Instead, it's just added as an optional aid.
