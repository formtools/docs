	<h4>Adding External Forms</h4>

	<p>
		To make integrating your own forms as pain-free as possible, the process is split into six
		discrete steps. Each step needs to be completed to successfully add a form for storage by
		Form Tools. If you are unable to finish setting up the form in one sitting, no problem! The
		values you've entered for each page are stored in memory so you can pick up where you left
		off. To keep things simple, the Add Form process only shows a subset of all the available
		options: things like setting up email notifications and Views can be set after the form
		has been successfully added. There's plenty of information on those steps elsewhere
		in the documentation.
	</p>

	<p>
		To add an External form, just select the External form on the main Add form page. That
		will open a dialog like the screenshot to the right. It's a checklist to confirm that
		you will be able to configure your form. You must be able to edit your form
		and that it is accessible via a URL.
	</p>

		In addition to the following pages in this documentation section, you might also be
		interested in these tutorials - they explain how to add your forms with more step-by-step
		instructions.

	</ul>

		The next step is to choose a submission method: process.php or API. Go to the next page
		to see a comparison between the two methods.
