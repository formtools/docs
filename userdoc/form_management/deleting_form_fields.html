	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i190.jpg" %}
		Deleting form fields is done through the <a href="/userdoc/form_management/edit_form_fields_tab">Edit Form
		&raquo;ui Fields</a> tab. It works very simply: just click the little "x" icon for those
		fields you'd like to delete and click the UPDATE button at the bottom of the page.
	</p>

	<p>
		But please be warned: <b>deleting a field on this page will delete it from all
		submissions!</b>. Deleting a form field cannot be undone, so please be very careful.
	</p>

	<p>
		Instead of deleting the actual form field, you might want to consider just removing it from
		one or more of your form Views. That way, it will never appear for you or your client
		accounts when browsing submissions. For more information on that, see the
		<a href="/userdoc/views">Views</a> section.
