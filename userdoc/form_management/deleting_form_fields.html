		Deleting form fields is done through the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/edit_form_fields_tab">Edit Form
		&raquo; Fields</a> tab. It works very simply: just click the little "x" icon for those
		fields you'd like to delete and click the UPDATE button at the bottom of the page.
	</p>

	<p class="alert alert-danger">
		<b>WARNING</b>: deleting a field on this page will delete it from all submissions! This cannot be undone, so
        please be very careful.
	</p>

	<p>
		Instead of deleting the actual form field, you might want to consider just removing it from one or more of your
        form Views. That way, it will never appear for you or your client accounts when browsing submissions. For more
        information on that, see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views">Views</a> section.
