	<p>
		Almost there! Step 5 gets down to the nitty gritty: specifying the field types, their
		value(s) and the how much space should be allocated in the database for each field. The
		page should look something like the screenshot to the right.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once the page has fully loaded, click the "Smart Fill" button.
	</p>

	<h5>How it works</h5>

	<p>
		You form page(s) are loaded in hidden iframe(s) in the page. If the form was on a different
		server, temporary copies are created locally so that the javascript can read them. When
		you click "Smart Fill" button, the page parses your form page(s) and tries to determine
		(a) their field type (dropdown, radio buttons etc) and (b) any multiple-select options they
		may have; namely: radios, dropdowns and checkboxes all have multiple options. The script
		figures all these out and displays them.
	</p>

	<p>
		From a coding standpoint, this is quite a complicated page and there are numerous things
		that could go wrong. For instance, if your webpage contains errors or is malformed, the
		Smart Fill option may not be able to run properly. Because of this, there are various
		safeguards in place so recommend courses of action. One such option is that if one or more
		of your form fields cannot be found, the page will provide you with the option of manually
		uploading copies of your form for it to be parsed directly. But for whatever reason, in case
		you cannot complete the page, you can always click the "Skip Step" button to bypass the page.
		You can always edit the form later to customize the fields then.
	</p>


	<h5>Limitations: checkboxes and radio buttons</h5>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i56.jpg" %}

	<p>
		Due to the nature of HTML, checkboxes and radio buttons have their labels located
		<b>outside</b> of the input field elements: technically they could appear anywhere in
		the webpage. For instance:
	</p>

	{% codemirror html %}
<!-- field types with their labels found outside of the element -->
<input type="radio" name="r1" /> My first radio!
My second radio: <input type="radio" name="r2" />

<input type="checkbox" name="c1" /> My first checkbox
My second checkbox: <input type="checkbox" name="c2" />

<!-- field types with their labels found inside the element -->
<select name="s">
	<option value="one">One</option>
	<option value="two">Two</option>
	<option value="three">Three</option>
</select>
	{% endcodemirror %}

	<p>
		Because of this, the Smart Fill feature doesn't pre-fill the display texts for checkboxes or
		radio buttons, since it doesn't know where to find them! Dropdowns always have their labels
		found in the same place, so they CAN be pre-filled.
	</p>

	h5>Field Sizes</h5>

	<p>
		The field size column specifies how much storage should be allocated for each field. Always
		make sure there's enough space! If you don't the form submission data will be truncated
		when it first gets added to the database!
	</p>

	<p>
		Users familiar with earlier versions of Form Tools may notice a couple of changes here:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The list of available field sizes is different, depending on the field type. For some
			field types (like textareas) it would make sense to be able to allocated only 5 or 20
			characters, whereas other field types (like textboxes) it would.</li>
		<li>There are two new sizes: 1 char and 2 chars. These are included because sometimes
			you only need that much space.</li>
	</ul>
