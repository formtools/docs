    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        Form Tools 3.3 is planning to re-write the way Form Tools handles permissions to provide a more powerful and
        <i>single</i> location for all account permissions. But until that release, the following information is correct.
    </p>

	<p>
		Form Tools lets you fine-tune the permissions to ensure that each user sees exactly what you want. Form permissions
        can be set in various places, on the:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Form-level</li>
		<li>View-level</li>
        <li>Module-level</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>1. Form Permissions</h3>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i219.jpg" %}
		The standard form-level permissions is right on the forms themselves. In the screenshot to the right you'll see the
        Edit Form » Main tab. There, take a look at the Access field. That has three options:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Administrator Only</li>
		<li>Public (all clients have account)</li>
		<li>Private (only specific clients have access)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This field assigns clients to the forms with a single broad stroke; only those client
		assigned to the forms will be able to access the form data. This setting affects the
		other two permissions listed above: Views and Export Groups. If you don't assign a
		client to the form, there's no point setting any further permissions - it won't matter!
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two other things to touch upon:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The <b>Public</b> option is a very convenient way to set the permissions for the form
			for all client accounts, <b>including those accounts that haven't been created yet</b>.
			So if you set your form to Public then create a new user account, that account will be
			automatically assigned to the form. This cuts down on unnecessary pointing and clicking later on.<br>
			<br>
            The public option also has a convenient <b>Omit List</b> option. This lets you keep
			the form as a public form, but excludes certain clients from seeing it. As we shall see,
			both the form and each form View have an optional omit list.
		</li>
		<li>
			When selecting the "Private" option, you'll see two additional multi-select dropdowns
			appear where you can select a specific clients. This is a simple way to choose a subset
			of all your client accounts that can see the form. Depending on your needs, this may be
			the simplest way to assign the client's form permissions.
		</li>
	</ol>


    <h3>2. View Permissions</h3>

	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views">elsewhere in the user documentation</a>, Views let you
		create any number of subsets of the form data, to present the information in the most convenient clear manner
        for yourself and your clients.  Every form has at least one View; every time you browse your form submissions
        you're looking at the information through a form View. You <b>never</b> look at the "raw" form data; it's
        always through a View: this is an important concept to understand. At first it may seem a little unnecessary and
		confusing, but it provides enormous control that wouldn't be possible otherwise.
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i255.gif" %}

		Views let you create any number of subsets of your form data including options like hiding/showing particular
        form fields, grouping them in tabs, making some editable and others non-editable, changing their sort order and
        limiting the submissions that will appear based on whatever criteria you need. e.g. only show submissions
        Vancouver that have been send to the Humanities department of the university.
	</p>

	<p>
		This extremely powerful functionality can be harnessed by the View permissions, letting you assign those
        information subsets to particular clients. View permissions work almost exactly like their parent forms.
        They have four options:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Administrator Only</li>
		<li>Public (all clients have account)</li>
		<li>Private (only specific clients have access)</li>
		<li>Hidden (used for programmatic reasons, hidden from clients and admin)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The only difference is that the client accounts that this section affects is the subset of
		client accounts that are assigned to the parent form. So if you have, say, 100 client account
		by set the form to "Private" with 5 clients assigned to it. The "Public" setting will only
		let those 5 clients access the View. Likewise, the Private option will show a multi-select
		dropdown with only 5 client accounts listed.
	</p>


	<h3>3. Modules</h3>

    <p>
        Different modules may also have their own permissions. For example, the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/data_visualization/">Data
        Visualization</a> module lets you specify which users can see the visualizations; the
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/report_builder/">Report Builder</a> modules lets you target specific forms
        to which the module applies. You'll need to review each module to see what functionality it offers and
        see the permissions settings within (if it exists).
    </p>

    <h4>Export Manager</h4>

	<p>
        Another module that has its own permissions is the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/export_manager/">Export Manager</a>.
		Controlling the Export Group permissions within this module is such a commonly used feature of the script,
        we thought we'd cover it here too.
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i265.gif" %}
		The list of available export options found at the bottom of the submission listing page is customizable for
        each client. To change these settings go to Modules » Export Manager and edit the export group for which you
        want to change the permissions.
	</p>

	<p>
		On that page, you'll see the (by now) familiar permission settings: Administrator only, Public and Private.
        Because the export groups are used for ALL forms, they will affect all clients, regardless of what form they
        are assigned to.
