	<h4>Adding Internal Forms</h4>

	{% include screenshot.html item='i208.jpg' %}

	<p>
		To add an Internal form, just click on the Add Form link in the left navigation menu.
		There, select the Internal form. That will open up a page where you create your new
		Internal form.
	</p>

	<p>
		The options are this page are very basic: you just enter the form name, how many fields it
		should have, and what permissions it should have (admin only, public or private). And don't
		worry! All these settings can be changed later.
	</p>


	{% include screenshot.html item='i209.jpg' %}

	<p>
		Lastly, click the "Add form" button. That's it! You now have a blank form created which
		you can start adding data through. That took, what... 10 whole seconds?
	</p>

	<div class="clear"></div>

	<h4>So now what?</h4>

	<p>
		Next you'll want to configure the form to store the information you want. What I'd
		do is click on the toggle icon at the top right of the screen (it's grey and has two
		icons side-by-side). That icon lets you switch between <i>editing</i> the form and
		<i>viewing</i> the submission data. It's a very convenient way to toggle back and
		forth to see how the changes you're making to the form configuration is being
		reflected when editing your form submissions.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the Submission Listing page, click "Add" to add a new submission to your form, then
		click "back to search results". That gives you an idea of what data is currently being
		stored. What you'll want to do now is click the toggle icon again, and go to the Edit Form
		-&gt; Fields tab. There, change the field names and field types to customize what data your
		form is storing. Just keep experimenting. At this stage, your form doesn't have any data,
		so you can add and delete fields without having to worry about losing any existing
		submission data. Play around with it!
		If you get stuck on anything, give <a href="../editing_forms">this section</a>
		a read over. It explains what all the various options are when editing your forms.
