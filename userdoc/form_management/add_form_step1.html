	<p>
		The first step is to choose your integration method. You have two options: POST / Direct, and
		the API. Click on the "benefits" / drawbacks" links for more information about each
		approach. Also, take a look at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_management/submission_type_comparison">this page</a> for
		a comparison of the two techniques - that can really help you figure out which method
		you'll want to use.
