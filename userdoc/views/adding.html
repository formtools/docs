	<p>
		Any time a form is created, a default View is created. This View
		contains all form fields, it's set to 10 submissions per page (or whatever value
		you've entered in the Settings -&gt; Main page), it orders the listings by
		submission date - most recent first, and is publicly accessible by all clients.
	</p>

	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item="i256.gif" %}
		Creating a new View is very simple. Just go to your Edit Form » Views tab and
		click the "Create View" link for whatever View group you want to add it to. This link
		it found at the <i>bottom right</i> of all View group sections. If you've
		deleted all the View Groups, you'll see the option to create a new, default View. Click it!
	</p>

	<p>
		Normally, when adding a new View, you'll see a dialog window appear that looks something
		like the screenshot to your right. This is extremely powerful: it lets you
		create a new View with all the fields, no fields, or base it on an existing View. If you
		find yourself needing to create multiple, similar Views, this can be a very important
		time-saver.
