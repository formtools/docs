	<h3>Main Tab</h3>

	{% include screenshot.html item='i258.gif' %}

	<p>
		The main tab contains the main, general settings for your View. Here's where you go
		to specify permissions and other such important info. As of 2.1.x, you can also
		come here to specify default values for your form submissions added within the Form
		Tools interface. This is a particularly nice addition - read below for more information.
	</p>

    <div class="clear"></div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>View Name</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This value is used to identify the View. It appears in both the administrator's and
            the client's UI. Generally you'll want to enter something human-friendly that
            clearly describes what information the View is encapsulating.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Submissions per page</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This determines the number of submissions that should appear in the main submission
            listing page. It affects all people accessing the View via the Form Tools UI.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Default Sort Order</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This value defaults to Submission Date descending (i.e. most recent first) for all
            new Views, but you can change it to whatever you need. Sometimes it can be beneficial
            to sort alphabetically, for example. Two tips:
            <ul>
                <li>Bear in mind that you DO have the option to allow any column to be sortable -
                    this may be set on the Fields tab.</li>
                <li>Even though this field lets you select any form field to acts as the default
                    sort order, you should probably choose a field that you specify in the
                    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/columns_tab/">Edit View &raquo; Columns tab</a>. That way, if the user changes the
                    sort order on the Submission Listing page, they can always click the original column
                    to achieve the old sort order. If you chose a field for the default sort order that
                    isn't a column, it could be a bit weird for the user!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Access</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This option lets you determine who can see the View. For more information on this
            setting, see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/permissions/">View Permissions</a> page.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>May delete submissions</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This option hides / shows the "DELETE" button on the main submission listing page and
            on the individual Edit Submission pages. This affects both client and administrator
            accounts.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>May add submissions</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This option hides / shows the "Add »" button on the main submission listing page and
            on the individual Edit Submission pages. This affects both client and administrator
            accounts. Tip: to control the label of this button, go to the Edit Form &raquo; main tab.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Default Values for New Submissions</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            If "May add submissions" is set to "yes", a new section will appear at the bottom of
            the page. This was added in 2.1.0 to allow you to specify default values for submissions
            added via the Form Tools interface. All you need to do is add those fields that you would
            like to contain default values, and specify exactly what values you want them to have.
            <ul>
                <li>Tip: a big reason this was added was to reconcile an issue that arose when adding
                    View Filters. Filters let you limit the results that appear in a View (e.g. only
                    show people from Vancouver, BC). When you added a submission in that View, even though
                    the submission was created, it wouldn't get listed in the View - because the value
                    of the "City" field wasn't "Vancouver". So, the <i>Default Values for New Submissions</i>
                    resolves this issue: it lets new submissions added to Views with standard filters
                    automatically contain the appropriate values to be listed in the View. Keep this in mind!
