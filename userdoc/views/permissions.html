	<p>
		Views can be targeted to specific audiences. Sometimes, you may find all of
		the form data should only be visible by the administrator, or that one or other
		subset of the form data should should be seen by particular client accounts. No
		problem! By mapping the permissions to the Views instead of the actual form,
		you get a huge amount of control over who sees what.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the Edit View » Main tab, there's an "Access" field. This lets you choose
		who can see the View. The options are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Administrator only</li>
		<li>Public (all clients have access)</li>
		<li>Private (only specific clients have access)</li>
		<li>Hidden</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The "Administrator only" option is straightforward: nobody except you will ever see
		the View. Public Views are automatically seen by everyone. This can be a convenient
		way to set the View permissions since they will be automatically visible to all
		clients associated with the form - including those that haven't been created yet.
		Setting a View to "Public" saves you the bother of having to manually configure
		the permissions for each new user as they are created.
	</p>

	<p>
		Also, the "Public" access type for Views is slightly different than the "Public" access
		type for forms. If you set a View to public, it will <b>still only show up for those
		clients assigned to the form - not all clients in the database</b>. Views will never be
		displayed for any users that aren't assigned to the form to which it belongs.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Private option lets you pinpoint precisely which clients can see the View.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Hidden option is handy if you want to create Views for programmatic purposes but
		don't want them to show up for anyone.
	</p>

	<h4>Omit Lists</h4>

	<p>
		Both public forms and public Views have omit lists. This can be convenient if you have
		a situation where you want the convenience of the public access type (so it's
		automatically) visible to newly created accounts, but you still don't want specific user
		accounts to have access.
	</p>

	<p>
		As you'd expect, the omit list for a form is also inherited by any of its Views. If
		a form has a "public" access level but John Smith is on the omit list, then he will never
		be able to see any of its Views, regardless of their access level.
	</p>
