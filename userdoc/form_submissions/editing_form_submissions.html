{% include open_section.html nav='nav_userdoc_form_submissions.html' selected='editing_form_submissions' %}

	<p>
		This page discussed the various features of the Edit Submission page. Everything here relates
		to both the administrator and client accounts - they both see virtually identical pages
		with the same features.
	</p>

	<p>
		As with the main Submission Listing page, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/form_submissions">discussed
		previously</a>, the contents of the Edit Submission page is largely determined by the form
		View that the user is currently browsing. The View determines the following aspects of the
		page: whether the fields are grouped in tabs or not; which fields are visible on each
		tab; which fields may be edited or not; the order of the fields; whether or not the
		"UPDATE" and "DELETE" buttons appear. This page explains each feature of the page.
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="100%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">Navigation links</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i310.gif" %}

				Any time you edit a submission, you'll see the three links at the top of the page:
				"« previous", "back to search results" and "next »". These provide you with
				a convenient navigation tool to browse through the <b>current result set</b>. They
				will navigate through whatever submissions were just displayed the last time you visited
				the main submissions page. When you are on the first or last item, the previous and next
				links are greyed out respectively.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">Toggle button (admin only)</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i309.gif" %}

				This appears for administrators only. It lets you quickly toggle between the edit form
				section to manage the form Views and viewing the submissions data. It can be handy if
				you're in the midst of configuring the form.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">Tabs</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i312.gif" %}

				This is an exciting new feature of Form Tools 2. It now lets you organize your form
				data into tabs, grouping related data as you see fit. You can define up to 6 tabs, each
				with a custom label. By default, all auto-generated views group form submissions
				on a single tab labeled "Data".
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">Fields</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i311.gif" %}

				The list of fields that appears on the Edit Submission page is again determined by the
				View. In fact, the View determines not just WHICH fields appear, but also whether they
				are editable and the order in which they appear. All this functionality is found on the
				Edit View » fields tab.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">UPDATE button</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i313.gif" %}

				The UPDATE button will appear on the Edit Submission page if there is one or more fields
				on the page that may be edited. Like the last feature, this is determined on the
				Edit View » fields tab. That tab contains all the controls for choosing which
				fields are editable and which are not. One caveat: if you're using tabs to group your
				data, any time a tab doesn't contain ANY editable fields, the UPDATE button won't
				appear. This should behave intuitively, but it was worth the mention!
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">DELETE button</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i308.gif" %}

				The DELETE button appears on the Edit Submission page if and only if the "May delete
				submissions that appear in this View" option has been enabled on the Edit View »
				main tab. This setting applies to everyone who uses the View - administrator and client.
				It also determines whether or not the DELETE button appears on the main Submissions page.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" width="160" valign="top">Emails section</td>
			<td>
				{% include screenshot.html item="i74.jpg" %}

				This section was added in Form Tools 2 to provide significantly more control for
				sending emails from the Edit Submission page. This feature works by letting you
				construct any number of pre-fab email templates like "Thanks for registering!"
				"Your payment has been processed" and so on, then on the Edit Submission page you can
				manually send them to whatever recipient list (usually the person / company who
				made the submission).<br>
				<br>
				To allow your email to be sent from the Edit Submission page, you need to edit the
				email template (Edit Form » Emails tab » Edit Email Template). There, click
				the "Advanced Settings" link to show a few hidden features and choose the appropriate
				value for the "Include option to send this email from Edit Submission page" option.
