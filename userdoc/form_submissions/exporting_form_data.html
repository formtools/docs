	<h3>The Export Manager Module</h3>

	{% include screenshot.html item="i265.gif" %}

	<p>
		All the ways that you can download the submission data is determined by a separate
		module called the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/export_manager/">Export Manager</a>. This
		(free) module comes bundled with the default installations of Form Tools, but it's entirely
		optional: you can uninstall it if you don't need it.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'll leave all discussion of the module to the module's own
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/export_manager/">help documentation</a>, but I
		will just mention a few important points.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Groups vs. Types</b>. The various ways to export your data are organized into groups.
			For example, the "HTML / Printer-friendly" option is an export group with three types:
			"table format", "one-by-one" and "one submission per page". You can define as many export groups
			and types as you need.</li>
		<li><b>Permissions</b>. The Export Manager lets you associate each export group with
			particular clients, with ALL clients or with only the administrator account.</li>
		<li><b>Generation Type</b>. The export groups can either open a popup (e.g. "HTML / printer-friendly"), prompt
			a file download (e.g. Excel), or even generate a file on the server. The XML format
			(disabled by default) is preconfigured for this last option, but you will need to enable
			it first.
		</li>
	</ul>
