		{% include screenshot.html item='i314.gif' %}
		The <b>accounts</b> tab controls the default settings for all new client accounts. Entering
		the appropriate values in this page can help you reduce the amount of configuration work
		for you. These settings merely act as the DEFAULT settings: you will still be able to override each
		setting for each client.
	</p>

	<p>
		The screenshot to the right shows the Accounts page in version <b>2.0.3</b> of the Core. In
		earlier versions, you won't see the Security Settings section.
	</p>

	<p>
		N.B. There was a minor change in 2.0.3 in that passwords are no longer limited to
		alphanumeric characters, as with 2.0.2 and earlier.

        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This setting determines the string that will appear in the web browser for the web page,
            via the &lt;title&gt; HTML node. You can enter whatever string you want, but bear in mind
            it will appear for all pages. It's a good idea to include the <b>{$page}</b> Smarty
            placeholder in this field, too. That placeholder is replaced with the actual page name
            for each page within the Form Tools UI.

            By default, this value is blank. But if you include a value, it will appear at the
            bottom of each page. A common use for this is to add a copyright line.

            This determines what page the client will get directed to after logging in. By default,
            this is set to the Forms page, but you pick whatever you want. This field is compatible
            with the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/pages/">Pages module</a> - so you can create
            custom pages and make them the client's login page.

            This setting lets you control the formatting of all dates within Form Tools. For
            non-English installations, you'll probably want to change this value to exclude any
            English strings. The formatting codes are from the php
            <a href="http://ca.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php">date()</a> function.

	<h3>Security Settings</h3>

	<p>
		As mentioned above, this section was added in 2.0.3. It provides a few additional security
		settings for the security-conscious. All these settings are turned off for new installations
		and upgrades.
	</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Auto-disable account after # failed login attempts</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This setting prevents brute-force attempts at hacking a user account. The script
            automatically disables the user account after a unbroken series of failed login
            attempts.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Minimum password length</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This lets you force client passwords to be of a minimum number of characters.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Required password characters</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            This settings is pretty self-explanatory: it lets you force the client account passwords
            to contain certain characters - uppercase, numbers and "special" chars. This can
            significantly reduce the likelihood of hackers guessing the account passwords.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Prevent re-use of # last passwords</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            Form Tools automatically logs passwords and password changes for client accounts. This
            setting lets you tap into that and prevent the client from re-using an old password.
            Preventing password re-use like this can again reduce the likelihood of successful
            hacking attempts.
