	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>
		Form Tools comes with its own user account system, letting you (the administrator)
		creating, modifying, deleting and disabling client user accounts. Setting up an account 
		provides a user with limited access to the Form Tools back-end administrative area. Depending 
		on how you configure the account, you can uniquely control what forms and Views they see, and what 
		data they are permitted to edit and export.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following sections explain the basic principles of creating and managing client accounts,
		including helpful tips on how to change the styles for a particular client user account.
