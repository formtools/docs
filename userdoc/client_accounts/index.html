	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>
		Form Tools comes with its own system for creating, modifying, deleting and disabling
		client user accounts. Setting up an account provides a user with limited access to the
		Form Tools back-end administrative area. Depending on what options you choose, you can
		assign specific forms to specific users allowing them to log into the program, view, manage
		and export their form data - but nobody else's.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every form stored within Form Tools is assigned to a single client. In order to add a new form
		for storage, you must first set up a corresponding client account to which it will be mapped.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following sections explain the basic principles of creating and managing client accounts,
		including helpful tips on how to change the styles for a particular client user account.
