	<p>
		Client account information is separated into three tabs: <b>main</b>, <b>settings</b>
		and <b>forms</b>. This has been shuffled around since Form Tools 1.x versions, with the
		former "styles" tab now moved to the separate <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/themes">Themes section</a>.
	</p>

	<h4>Main tab</h4>

	<p>
		The main tab contains all information about the client themselves, including name,
		login information and email address. Note that the username and password fields may only
		contain alphanumeric characters(a-z, A-Z, 0-9). All account passwords are now encrypted
		in the database, so you only need to re-enter the password if you wish to change it.
		Otherwise, leave the fields blank.
	</p>

	<p>
		The status field controls the overall status of the user account. It has three options:
		<b>active</b>, <b>pending</b> and <b>disabled</b>. "Pending" is an option supplied for
		completeness: the Form Tools API allows you to programmatically create accounts, e.g.
		you could have a "sign up" form on your website. This setting is the default value for
		all programmatically craeated accounts, letting you quickly identify which accounts have
		been requested. If you're not concerned about this feature, just ignore the option.
	</p>


	<h4>Settings tab</h4>

	<p>
		If you've been looking around the other administration pages, the Edit Client »
		Settings tab may look familiar. It's a carbon copy of the Settings » Accounts tab,
		containing exactly the same options. The Settings » Accounts tab contains the
		default settings for all newly created client accounts. This is a convenient way to
		choose those settings you'd like to set for all future accounts, saving you the bother
		of having to manuall set each account. On the Edit Client » Settings tab, you have
		the option of overriding any of those default values for this client.
	</p>

	<p>
		By and large, the content on this tab should be largely self-explanatory. The one hidden
		option is that you may include a <b>{$page}</b> placeholder in the Page Titles field.
		Each page in the UI has it's own label ("e.g. Edit View"). This placeholder is converted
		to the appropriate meaning for each page.
	</p>

	<h4>Forms tab</h4>

	<p>
		The last tab lists those forms and Views which this client can access. For more information
		on the nuances of this page, see the following <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/client_accounts/account_permissions">Account
		Permissions</a> page.
