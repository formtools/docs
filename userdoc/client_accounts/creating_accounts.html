		Note: you can only create client accounts, not any more administrators. Form Tools allows
		for a single administrator account which is created during the installation phase.

		To create a new client account, click on the <b>Clients</b> link on the left navigation
		column, then on the "Add Client" button in the page. Fill in all required fields (those
		marked with an asterix) and click the "Add Client" button at the bottom. Assuming all
		fields were entered with valid values, you will be redirected to a new page for editing
		this client account.
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools 2.0.3 introduced a number of security features to force client passwords
		to meet certain criteria: length and content. When creating new accounts, those criteria
		are defined on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/client_accounts/account_settings">Settings
		» Accounts tab</a>. Read that page for a description of the various fields. If you have any
		of the settings enabled concerning the client account passwords, you should see a message on the screen
		describing the required criteria. An example of this is shown on the screenshot on this page.
	</p>

	<p>
		For older versions of Form Tools, the security settings are not there: don't worry about
		them!
