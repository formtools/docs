	<p>
		Client account permissions split into two categories: those relating to their own user
		account settings, and those relating to managing and viewing the data. For information
		on the former, see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/client_accounts/editing_accounts/">Editing
        Accounts</a> page - especially the comments on the Settings tab.
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools 2 lets you specify precisely what form information can be viewed and edited,
		down to each and every form field. We tried to balance functionality with usability to
		allow for this, so please let us know if you feel certain functionality is missing, or if
		the user interface is unclear.
	</p>

	<p>
		In order for a client to view a form, they need to be both assigned to the form, and to
		one or more Views within the form. Assigning the client to a form is merely a generic
		"blanket" setting, it doesn't provide any control over the details: that's handled by
		the Views. Views let you customize subsets of the data - both in terms of what
		fields are displayed and in what order, and in terms of which results appear in the
		View. For more information, see the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/views/">Views section</a>. Client
		permissions are fundamentally about Views; once you learn how to create Views, changing
		permissions for a particular client account is as simple as assigning a client to the
		View.
