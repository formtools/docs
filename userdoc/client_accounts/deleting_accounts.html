	<p>
		Deleting a client account completely removes that user from the database, preventing them
		from logging in. Additionally, any email templates that include them as a (non-custom)
		recipient will be updated to no longer email them.
	</p>
	<p>
		deleting a user account does not remove any of that client's forms. Each form must be
		deleted separately.
	</p>
	<p>
		To delete an account, simply click on the <b>Manage Clients</b> link in the leftmost navigation
		column, and click the appropriate DELETE link. Be very careful! This cannot be undone.
