	<p>
		The recipient(s) tab lets you control the email "headers", namely: the recipient list,
		the subject line and the reply-to and from email addresses.
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="info" width="100%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="120" class="blue" valign="top">Recipient(s)</td>
			<td>
				This field lets you define who should receive this email. The dropdown contains four
				sections: <b>administrator</b>, <b>clients</b>, <b>user</b> and <b>other</b>. The admin
				and clients group contain recipients that are dynamically pulled from the database. The
				benefit to picking them here is that (a) it saves you some typing and makes it less
				likely you type in an email address incorrectly, and (b) any time the account
				information changes, the emails will automatically be updated too. The "user" option
				specifies the user who submitted the form. This will only appear if your form contains
				an email address for the sender, and you have <a href="?page=configure_form_email_fields">configured
				it with Form Tools</a>.<br>
				<br>
				Make sure you click the "ADD" button to add the desired recipient.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Subject Line</td>
			<td>
				This is the subject line of the email. You can enter placeholders (strings of text
				that are converted to other values) in this field to precisely customize the subject
				line. For a list of available placeholders, see the Reference tab.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">From</td>
			<td>
				This lets you determine who the email is coming from. It's generally a good idea
				to include <b>someone's</b> email address here, because emails sent without a "from"
				sometimes incorrectly get identified as spam and never make it to the recipient's
				inbox.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Reply-to</td>
			<td>
				This lets you determine the reply-to header of the email; i.e. where the email will
				go to if they click "reply" in their email client.
			</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody></table>

		If you have the Swift Mailer module installed and configured, you will also see an
		"undeliverable email recipient" field here. Please see the following page in the
		<a href="http://modules.formtools.org/swift_mailer/?page=undeliverable_emails">Swift Mailer
			documentation</a> for more information.
