	<p>
		The configuration tab contains the main settings for your email template: the "meta"
		settings which determine how the email template should behave.
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="100%" class="info">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="180" class="blue" valign="top">Email Template Name</td>
			<td>
				This is used to help you identify the email template; it is only used internally and
				doesn't appear in the email contents at all. You should use this field to try to
				describe the email, e.g. "Administrator notification", "email sent to user",
				"submission updated", "email sent to Accounting department", etc.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Status</td>
			<td>
				Whether the email should be sent or not.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="blue" valign="top">Event Trigger</td>
			<td>
				This determines on which events the email should get sent. Currently there are only
				three options: when the submission is first put through, when it is edited and when
				it's deleted. You may also want to look at the next setting ("When sent") for related
				functionality.
			</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody></table>

	<p>
		At the foot of the tab, there are also some additional fields grouped in an
		"Advanced Settings" section. We figured these settings may not be that useful for
		most people, so we tucked them away from public view.
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" width="100%" class="info">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td width="180" class="blue" valign="top">When Sent</td>
			<td>
				This is a very powerful setting! It lets you map an email template to a particular
				View - but not ANY View: only Views that have one or more filters defined. Views let
				you define ways to view subsets of all your form information; filters are special in
				they limit the results themselves: e.g. if 100 submissions were put through, a View
				with a filter may only show 50 of them.<br>
				<br>
				This setting displays the dropdown of Views with filters since they are the only ones
				that are relevant in this case. The setting ensures the email only gets sent if
				the submission appears in the View. For example, say your form is collecting
				registrations for a university course and one of the fields is "are you an
				international student?". You could create a View called "International Students"
				that only contains international students. You could then create an email that ONLY
				get's sent to them by selecting the View in this field. Neat, huh?
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="120" class="blue" valign="top">Include option to send this email from Edit Submission page</td>
			<td>
				This option should probably be pretty self-explanatory. It determines whether the
				administrator and any client accounts can manually send the email directly on the
				Edit Submission page. By mapping it to a particular View, you effectively control
				the permissions. Only clients assigned to a particular View can therefore send the
				email.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="120" class="blue" valign="top">Limit email content to fields in View</td>
			<td>
				This setting is NOT self-explanatory, so hopefully we can shed a little light on it!
				As discussed above, the "When sent" setting allows you to map an email template to a
				particular View. Because of this, it's altogether possible that the View you're
				mapping it to only displays a subset of the form fields as well as having a filter
				defined. Hence, it seems reasonable that you only want the email to contain those
				fields in the View - not all fields defined in the form.<br>
				<br>
				This setting limits the fields passed in the <b>{$fields}</b> variable to the Smarty
				loop in your email content to only those fields defined in the View. In other words,
				if you're using an email template created with any of the "Smarty Loop" options,
				the generated content will only contain fields in the View.<br>
				<br>
				The need for this may not be immediately clear. After all, you can always customize
				the email contents by manually entering which fields should appear. However, as
				discussed elsewhere, there are several benefits to using a Smarty loop over the
				simple list of placeholders: one being that more information about the fields are
				passed via the Smarty loop, another being that if you ever change your View, the email template
				doesn't need to be manually updated.
