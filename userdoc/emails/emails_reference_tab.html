	<p>
		The Reference tab contains all the placeholders at your disposal. These placeholders can
		be entered anywhere in (a) the email's Subject Line field and (b) the email content
		fields. They will be replaced with the corresponding value.
	</p>

	<p>
		The placeholders are arranged in three sections:
	</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Global Placeholders</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            Global placeholders can be used in any template and any form.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3"><code>Form Placeholders</code></div>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            The list of form placeholders are unique to your form. For input fields, textareas,
            password fields, radio buttons, dropdowns and multi-select dropdowns, there are always
            two placeholders generated for each. These are of the form:
        </div>
    </div>
