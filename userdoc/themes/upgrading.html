	<p>
		Upgrading themes is very simple. Themes, modules, the Form Tools API and the Form Tools Core
		script are all upgraded in the same way. Log into Form Tools (as an administrator) and to to
		your Settings » Main tab. There, click the "Check for Updates" button. That submits
		all relevant information about your installation - including your theme versions - to the Form
		Tools site. The upgrade script then determines what components, if any, have been updated
		and generates a custom zipfile containing whatever you want to upgrade.
	</p>

	<p>
		The generated zipfiles mock the folder structure of your Form Tools installation exactly, and
		only contain the files you need to overwrite. So, to upgrade the files, just upload the
		entire root folder to your own server, overwriting the old files. Once this is completed,
		log back into Form Tools and go to the Settings » Themes page. There, click the
		"REFRESH THEME LIST" button. That will update the database with that latest theme versions.
