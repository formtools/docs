<p>
    Installing a new theme is very simple.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>First, <a href="https://themes.formtools.org">browse the available themes</a> list on the
        Form Tools site to locate the theme you want.
    </li>
    <li>Next, download the theme to your desktop.
        <ul>
            <li>For zipfiles, unzip the file on your computer using whatever
                compressor/decompressor you have installed (Winzip, 7-zip).
            </li>
            <li>
            <li>
                <div class="alert alert-warning">
                    <b>Important step!</b> the unzipped folder will be named something like this:
                    <code>theme-classicgrey-2.0.5</code>. Rename that to <code>classicgrey</code> -
                    i.e. remove the <b>theme-</b> prefix and the <b>-X.Y.Z</b> suffix.
                </div>
            </li>
            </li>
            All themes are located in their own unique folder. Send the single folder to your webserver via FTP;
            it should be placed in your <b>[form tools root]/themes</b> folder.
            </li>
            <li>For tar.gz files, FTP the folder to your <b>[form tools root]/themes</b>
                folder on your webserver. SSH or telnet into your server and go to the themes folder.
                There, run this command (replace name_of_tar_file_here with the name of your tar
                file):
                <blockquote>
                    <pre>tar -xzvf name_of_tar_file_here.tar.gz</pre>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Next, log into Form Tools and go to the Settings » Themes page. Here, click the
        "REFRESH THEME LIST" button. And that's it! You should now see your new theme.
    </li>
</ol>
