	<p>
		{% include screenshot.html item='i319.gif' %}
		Form Tools 2 pages are all generated through themes. Themes are simply a set of CSS,
		JavaScript files, images and Smarty templates. Smarty templates are just HTML, with
		special logical rules and placeholders that provide more control to the
		theme developer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools allows you to install multiple themes and have different accounts associated
		with each theme; e.g. you could have 5 people logged in at the same time, viewing the same
		content but through very different themes. This can be beneficial in a number of ways:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The UIs of some themes may be more intuitive and attractive that others to different
			users. Because of this, it's often a good idea to let client accounts have permissions to
			choose their own theme (this can be set for all future accounts on the
			<a href="?page=account_settings">Settings » Accounts tab</a>).</li>
		<li>Some themes may have browser requirements that don't fit all users (e.g. a modern
			browser or large screen dimensions</li>
		<li>If your installation is being used to store forms for different websites, themes let
			you "brand" the UI for each user - they could see a theme that looks like their own website,
			for example.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Theme Versions</h4>

	<p>
		Form Tools is in a perpetual state of revision and development. Because of this, the
		webpages used to render the HTML are always in flux. So how can you be sure that a theme
		supports a particular version? Well, first of all, themes themselves have versions. Each
		version is associated with one or more Form Tools Core versions. This lets you know whether
		a theme is compatible with your installation or not. Secondly, to promote compatibility
		and reduce the amount of work needed from theme developers, the themes themselves were
		designed with a simple fallback mechanism. Theme developers don't need to creates
		pages for every  page in the UI: just a handful of main global files. So, even if a theme
		was developed long before a version of the Core, chances are it's still compatible. Also,
		the upgrade script keeps track of dependencies and will always warn you if a new version
		of the Core code is incompatible with a theme.
	</p>

	<h4>The default theme</h4>

	<p>
		The <b>default</b> theme is special: it's always bundled with Form Tools and is always
		up to date; it contains all the pages required to properly display all pages in the
		interface. You should never delete the default theme. Deleting the default theme will
		prevent the script from working properly.
	</p>

	<p>
		The screenshot at the top of the page is of the Settings » Themes page, rendered
		using the default theme.
	</p>

	<p>
		As of Form Tools 2.1.3, the default theme includes 10 separate <i>swatches</i>, which
		let you display the default theme in a variety of different colours.
