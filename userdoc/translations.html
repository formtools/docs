<p>
  As of Form Tools 3, all translations are part of the Core. You don't have to go out of your way to locate or download them. 
  For earlier versions of Form Tools, visit the <a href="https://github.com/formtools/translations">Translations</a> repo.
</p>

<p>
  Please note, these translation files are just for the Core. Modules are compatible with internationalization, but none of
  them have any languages other than English.
