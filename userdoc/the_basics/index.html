	<h3>About Form Tools</h3>

	<p>
		Form Tools is a <i>forms framework</i> written in PHP and MySQL. At its heart, it's
		a <strong>web form creator, processor, data storage and access script</strong>. It was originally
		designed to work with any existing web form, but has since been expanded to create forms automatically
		as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools is very versatile in how it integrates with your forms. You can use the Form Builder module
		interface to create them automatically (no programming / HTML skills necessary), you can use the PHP API
		to integrate your own custom form with the script, or you can simply POST your form to Form Tools, which can
		be used a storage script independent of your form. Anything goes!
	</p>

	<p>
		Form Tools works by creating custom database tables to store the unique data and structure of your form. It
		then provides a range of functionality customized to your data set, such as allowing you to view, update,
		cross-reference and export your submission data, sorting and categorization of the data, form submission
		editing, emailing of form submissions and a lot more.
	</p>
	<p>
		To our knowledge, there's no other script out there that was designed in the same way - or
		any that provide anywhere near the degree of control over your data that Form Tools affords you.
	</p>

	<h3>Feature Highlights</h3>

	<p>
		Here are some of the script's key features:

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-2">
			<strong>Free!</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-10">
			Yup! Form Tools is available under the <a href="http://docs.formtools.org/license.php">GNU Public License</a>,
			free for anyone to download and modify. With 2.1.0, we're in the process of introducing
			a number of premium modules - but all the core functionality and script is still free.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-2">
			<strong>Re-usable</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-10">
			A single installation can handle as many forms as you wish - even from different
			websites. You can set up as many client accounts as you wish, enabling multiple
			users to log in, view and manage their own data online. Form Tools 2 provides a
			wide palette of permission settings to allow you to precisely customize who sees
			what.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-2">
			<strong>Generic</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-10">
			Very little modification to the web forms is needed to allow Form Tools to store
			their content. It works with virtually any web form!
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-2">
			<strong>Brandable</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-10">
			By simply designing a default image and changing a few default values in the
			Setup Options, you may customize Form Tools as belonging to your own company.

			The entire script is theme-based, using Smarty templates to generate the HTML.
			If need be, you can customize the UI for each of your clients so that it looks
			completely different for each user.
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-2">
			<strong>Extensible</strong>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-10">
			Form Tools 2 is fully modular, and some additional
			<a href="http://docs.formtools.org/module_development/">documentation</a> has been
			written to help you extend the script in whatever way you need. In addition, one of
			our main goals was to allow strong integration between our script and the outside
			world. For example, it was designed to be used in conjunction with other software,
			such as online credit card payment processing; the script is also designed to allow
			data export in a variety of (customizable) formats, such as XML. And, of course,
			since the code is downloadable for free under the <a href="http://docs.formtools.org/license.php">GNU
			Public License</a>, you can always access and edit the code yourself!
