	<p>
		Unlike other form processors, Form Tools was designed to be completely separate
		from the forms themselves.
	</p>

	<h4>That's weird. Why?</h4>

	<p>
		Forms come in all shapes and sizes, utilizing a variety of technologies -
		HTML, Ajax, Flash, Silverlight, etc. Different situations require different technologies;
		different problems require different solutions. So rather than force you to implement
		your forms in a particular way, our approach was to focus on the form <i>processing</i>
		instead: our goal was to provide a simple, clear user interface for managing the form
		information.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are many excellent form builders out there - some desktop applications, some
		web-based. All of them generate forms in different ways, and depending
		on your needs, one may be a better fit than another. That's when Form Tools steps in:
		it doesn't care WHERE the form came from: it can be used with any of them.
	</p>

	<h4>Having said all that...</h4>

	<p>
		Having said all that, Form Tools 2.1.0 does actually let you generate forms within the
		interface, and, with the aid of the premium
		<a href="http://modules.formtools.org/form_builder/?page=index">Form Builder
			module</a>, publish them directly on your site. The Form Builder simply provides you with
		another means to creating your forms: it is <i>not</i> required, and depending on your
		particular scenario, you may prefer to build your own forms.
