	<p>
		Form Tools is organized into the following components:
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="info">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td valign="top" class="bold" width="140">Form Tools Core</td>
			<td>
				The Core contains all code required for the most basic usage of the script. It
				includes the default theme, which ensures that the HTML for rendering the pages is
				always up to date, and the default English translation file. You can
				see what's changed in the Core code by looking at the
				<a href="http://docs.formtools.org/changelog.php">Core changelog</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" class="bold">Modules</td>
			<td>
				Modules are separate components which perform individual tasks. They are installed
				and uninstalled by the Form Tools administrator. Like the other API and themes,
				they are totally separate from the Core. You can see a list of all modules
				here: <a href="http://modules.formtools.org">modules.formtools.org</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" class="bold">Themes</td>
			<td>
				<a href="http://themes.formtools.org">Themes</a> let you customize the appearance of
				the interface for any Form Tools user. There are a few to choose from, and you can
				always create your own should you want to.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" class="bold">API</td>
			<td>
				The <a href="http://docs.formtools.org/api/?page=index">API</a> (<i>Application Programming
				Interface</i>) is a set of functions written for programmers who'd like to use
				Form Tools functionality and data within their own code / websites.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top" class="bold">Translation Files</td>
			<td>
				Every language string within Form Tools is loaded from a language file. The
				translation files can be downloaded from
				<a href="http://translations.formtools.org">translations.formtools.org</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody>
