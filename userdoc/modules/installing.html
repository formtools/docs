	<p>
		Installing a new module is very simple.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>First, <a href="http://modules.formtools.org">browse the available modules</a> list on the
			Form Tools site to locate the module you want.</li>
		<li>Download the module to your desktop.
			<ul>
				<li>For zipfiles, unzip the file on your computer using whatever compressor/decompressor you have
					installed. All modules are located in their own unique folder. Send the single folder to your
					webserver via FTP; it should be placed in your <b>[form tools root]/modules</b> folder.</li>
				<li>For tar.gz files, FTP the tar file to your <b>[form tools root]/modules</b>
					folder on your webserver. SSH or telnet into your server and go to the modules folder.
					There, run this command (replace name_of_tar_file_here with the name of your tar
					file):

					{% highlight html %}
tar -xzvf name_of_tar_file_here.tar.gz
					{% endhighlight %}

				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Next, log into Form Tools and go to the Modules page. Here, click the
			"REFRESH MODULE LIST" button. And that's it! You should now see your new module.
		</li>
		<li>
			{% include screenshot.html item='i244.jpg' %}
			For free modules, just click the INSTALL button and the module will be instantly
			installed. For premium modules, you will see a dialog window appear where you need to
			enter your license key. Please note: <i>you must be connected to the internet in order
			to install any premium module</i>. Installing premium modules requires confirmation of
			your license key from the Form Tools site.
		</li>
	</ol>
