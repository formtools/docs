		The second step runs a few key tests on your server to confirm that Form Tools will be
		able to run. The full system requirements are
		<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/userdoc/the_basics/system_requirements/">outlined here</a>,
		but the most common problems encountered on this page are these:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>MySQL version identified as incorrect</b>. Form Tools requires MySQL 4 or later
			to run. If you think your version is compatible, just click the "Ignore" button to bypass
			the error.
		</li>
		<li><b>Write permissions</b>. The /themes/default/cache folder needs to be read-writable.
			If you're on a Windows server, you may need to contact your hosting provider to ask them
			to set the permissions on that folder appropriately.</li>
		<li><b>Core Field Types module not installed</b>. As of Form Tools 2.1.5, the
			<a href="http://modules.formtools.org/core_field_types/?page=index">Core Field Types</a> module
			is now required. It comes included in all the default download packages, but if you
			used the <a href="http://www.formtools.org/build/">Custom Build script</a>, you may
			not have included it. To remedy this, just download the module and upload it to your
			/modules folder. Then refresh the Form Tools installation page and it will automatically
			detect that it's ready to be installed.</li>
	</ul>
